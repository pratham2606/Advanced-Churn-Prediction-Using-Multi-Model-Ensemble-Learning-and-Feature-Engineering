# *Advanced-Churn-Prediction-Using-Multi-Model-Ensemble-Learning-and-Feature-Engineering*
In the competitive landscape of modern business, customer retention is paramount. High churn rates can lead to significant revenue loss and hinder growth. This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning, enabling proactive retention strategies. The dataset comprises various customer attributes, including demographics, account details, and usage patterns, which are critical for understanding customer behavior.
Task
The primary objective of this project is to construct a robust predictive framework that accurately identifies customers likely to churn. The project encompasses:

Comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering.
Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models.
Utilizing ensemble techniques to enhance predictive performance.
Visualizing model performance and feature importance to derive actionable insights.
Action
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

The dataset was sourced from a customer database, containing features such as age, account tenure, service usage, and customer feedback.
Data preprocessing involved:
Handling missing values through imputation techniques (mean/mode imputation for numerical/categorical features).
One-hot encoding for categorical variables to convert them into a numerical format suitable for model training.
Normalization of numerical features to ensure uniform scaling, enhancing model convergence during training.
Model Selection:

A diverse set of machine learning algorithms was employed, including:
Logistic Regression: A foundational model for binary classification, providing a baseline for performance.
Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble method utilizing bagging to mitigate overfitting by averaging predictions from multiple decision trees.
Gradient Boosting Classifier: A boosting technique that sequentially builds models, focusing on correcting the errors of previous iterations.
XGBoost: An optimized gradient boosting framework known for its computational efficiency and performance.
LightGBM: A gradient boosting framework that employs a histogram-based approach for faster training and lower memory usage.
CatBoost: A gradient boosting library that automatically handles categorical features, reducing preprocessing overhead.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful classifier that constructs hyperplanes in high-dimensional spaces to separate classes.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): An instance-based learning algorithm that classifies based on the majority class of the nearest neighbors.
Model Evaluation:

The dataset was split into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets to assess model performance.
Models were evaluated using key metrics:
Accuracy: The proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances.
Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives, indicating the model's ability to avoid false positives.
Recall (Sensitivity): The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives, reflecting the model's ability to identify all relevant instances.
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.
Ensemble Techniques:

Implemented stacking to combine the predictions of multiple models, using a meta-learner (Logistic Regression) to improve overall performance. This approach leverages the strengths of individual models while mitigating their weaknesses.
Visualization and Analysis:

Feature Importance: Visualized using bar plots to identify the most influential features contributing to customer churn. This analysis helps in understanding customer behavior and guiding retention strategies.
Confusion Matrix: Generated for each model to visualize true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, providing insights into model performance and areas for improvement.
Learning Curves: Plotted to assess model performance as a function of training set size, helping to diagnose overfitting or underfitting issues.
Model Comparison: Utilized box plots to compare the performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) across different models, facilitating a clear visual representation of their effectiveness.
Libraries Used:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, enabling efficient handling of large datasets.
NumPy: For numerical computations, providing support for multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms, evaluation metrics, and model selection techniques.
XGBoost: For advanced gradient boosting capabilities, enhancing model performance.
LightGBM: For efficient gradient boosting, particularly with large datasets.
CatBoost: For handling categorical features seamlessly, reducing preprocessing complexity.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization, providing a comprehensive suite of plotting capabilities to create informative and aesthetically pleasing graphics.
